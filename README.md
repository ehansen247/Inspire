# Inspire
A living database of quotes intended to inspire. 

Search a database of over 4,000 quotes, check out our daily quotes, or write and save your own quote in our database.
Created with Angular front end, Node.js/Express on the server-side, and a PostgreSQL database hosted by Heroku.  

After cloning the repo, call both "npm run start" from the "nodeBackEnd" directory and "npm start" from the 
"angularFrontEnd" directory. The web app's functionality requires that the both the application's client and server 
are running from the localhost. Afterwards, navigate to localhost:4200 to see the homepage.
